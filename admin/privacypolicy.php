            <h5>Do we use 'cookies'?</h5>
            
            <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your
            Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture
            and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping
            cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables
            us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and
            site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>
            
            <h5>We use cookies to:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand and save user's preferences for future visits.</li>
                <li>Keep track of advertisements.</li>
                <li>Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools
                in the future. We may also use trusted third-party services that track this information on our behalf.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all
                cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Since browser is a little different, look at your browser's Help Menu
                to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.<br>

            <h5>Third-party disclosure</h5>
            <p>
                We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information unless we
                provide users with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us
                in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep
                this information confidential. We may also release information when it's release is appropriate to comply with the
                law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property or safety. <br><br>

            </p>
            <h5>Third-party links</h5>
            <p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our website. These
            third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for
            the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome
            any feedback about these sites.</p>
            
            <h5>Google</h5>
            <p>Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in place to

            We have not enabled Google AdSense on our site but we may do so in the future.</p>
            
            <h5>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h5>
            <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.
            The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably
            the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a
            conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies
            with whom it is being shared. -

            <h5>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</h5>
            <p>
                Users can visit our site anonymously.<br>
                Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first
                significant page after entering our website.<br>
                Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.<br><br>
                
                <p>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>On our Privacy Policy Page</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Can change your personal information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>By emailing us</li>
                    <li>By logging in to your account</li>
                    <li> By chatting with us or by sending us a support ticket</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h5>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</h5>
            <p>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser
            mechanism is in place.</p>
            
            <h5>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h5>
            <p>It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking</p>
            
            <h5>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h5>
            <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's
            Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer
            protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to
            protect children's privacy and safety online.<br><br>
            We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.
            </p>
            <h5>Fair Information Practices</h5>
            <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they
            include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the
            Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws
            that protect personal information.</p>
            
            <h5>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data
            breach occur:</h5>
            <p>We will notify you via email</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Within 1 business day <br>We will notify the users via in-site notification</li>
                <li>Within 1 business day<br>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the
                right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.
                This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals
                have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h5>CAN SPAM Act</h5>
            <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages,
            gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
            </p>
            <h5>We collect your email address in order to:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</h5>
            <p><b>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at</b>and we will
            promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.</p><br>
